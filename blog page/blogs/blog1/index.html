        <h1>Ecology v/s Economy?</h1>
        <img src="../../resource/blogimagetools.jpg" alt="img">
       <p>Economy and ecology are often presented as opposing disciplines. The main reason why ecological concerns have not become everybody’s concern is simply because of the ignorant attitude of considering it being against everything that is for economic well being. Economics, which deals with the allocation of scarce human-made and natural resources, is viewed unfavorably by many who are concerned about the effects of society on the environment and natural resources. It is burdened, in particular, by a misperception that it is synonymous with finance. While ecology, which deals with nature's allocation of scarce resources, is more often viewed in a favorable light. 

        We’ve always pitched economy versus ecology. That’s a fundamental thing that needs to be changed in India and everywhere. In fact, a marriage between economy and ecology must be officiated with due priority. Because these two things can’t go against each other, there’s no way to do it other than coupling them. It is to be noted here that we need not destroy businesses, we just have to transform businesses. And the necessary time, room and policy support is needed to transform them. 
        
        The Environmental Kuznets curve depicts that economic development initially leads to a deterioration in the environment, but after a certain level of economic growth, a society begins to improve its relationship with the environment and levels of environmental degradation reduces. 
        <br>
        <br>
<br>
        
Empirical evidence of declining pollution levels with economic growth was supported by studies that found that higher economic growth in the US led to increased use of cars, but at the same time, due to regulation, levels of air pollution, in particular sulphur dioxide levels declined. Also, progress in solar and other renewable technologies have been great examples of how improved technology has reduced potential for environmental damage. Another evidence in support being, the technology of car use since the 1950s has significantly improved fuel efficiency. Secondly, it's assumed that, with higher rates of economic growth, people have more discretionary income after paying for basic necessities, therefore, they are more amenable to paying higher prices in return for better environmental standards; and that the government would also be able to implement taxes and regulations in an attempt to solve environmental externalities which harm health and living standards.
  <br>
  <br>
<br>
  The other side of the coin reflects that, empirical evidence is mixed. There is no such guarantee that economic growth will see an improved environmental condition. Moreover, pollution is not simply a function of income, but many factors such as the effectiveness of government regulation, the development of the economy, and population levels. Many developed economies have seen a reduction in industry and growth in the service sector, but they are still importing goods from developing countries. In that sense, they are exporting environmental degradation! Pollution may reduce in the developed economies, but countries who export to them are seeing higher levels of environmental degradation. One example is with regard to deforestation. Higher-income countries tend to stop the process of deforestation, but at the same time, they still import meat and furniture from countries who are creating farmland out of forests. 

Economists and critics argue that, if economy continues to expand, then inevitably some resources will continue to be used in greater measure, indicating no guarantee that long-term levels of environmental degradation will continue to fall. Countries with the highest GDP having highest levels of CO2 emission is an evident proof in itself! Thus, the link between levels of income and environmental degradation is quite weak. It is possible economic growth will be compatible with an improved environment, but it requires a very deliberate set of policies and willingness to produce energy and goods in the most environmentally friendly way.

Technically speaking, Ecological Economics is a transdisciplinary field focusing on the linked goals of sustainability, fairness in distribution, and efficiency in allocation. The vision includes recognition that: 
<br>
<br>
<br>
   <ul>
    <li>Our planet is essentially a closed system in which our societies are subsystems;</li>
    <li>A sustainable future exists for all species that is constrained by the global ecosystem;
    </li>
    <li>We should be cautious and humble, given the many uncertainties that exist and Our policies must become more proactive, with clearer thought about the interrelationships of the earth's subsystems. 
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   The vision reflects that, our idea of what is profit, what is a successful business, has to go through some transformation. It’s definitely not a one day’s job. It needs to happen gradually over a period of time. Today, a whole lot of businesses are looking at how they can impact ecological sustainability and are investing in it. This was simply absent twenty-five years ago. Barack Obama's long made remark, “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it!” hasn't stopped to haunt me until this moment.

Inorder to make the world realize the heat of human civilization being on 
a deadline to prevent planet-wide climate disaster, and to get the message across, a Climate Clock, ten stories high in Manhattan’s Union Squarelock in New York has been set up, which counts down the time remaining to avert Climate Disaster. The installation began its count down on September 17, 2020 with seven years, 103 days, 15 hours, 40 minutes and seven seconds! So, the next ten years, probably, in the history of humanity, is going to be very crucial in terms of what kind of corrections we make. If we take care of the soil, rivers, forests, agriculture, human health – everything will be taken care of. We, as a generation of people, have this responsibility, that in this mean time, at least at the policy level, all the right things happen.

Most nations on the planet are democracies. If the citizens do not manifest this and make it very clear, a democratically elected government will not do anything. We must be willing to sacrifice a few conveniences for a larger and long-term good. If we do not express that, no government will make any policy. Only when there is a policy change, the budget reallocations are there, and a sustained movement towards ecologically economic consciousness is established.

Fundamentally, the most important thing is, human beings have lost connection with what is life and everything that nourishes and sustains life around us. Ecology is thus, not an academic subject, it is the very basis of our existence. To bring this experience to people large-scale is highly important. Because one can teach and campaign as much as one wants, but people shape their lives according to their experience of life. Especially those people who hold positions of responsibility and power, who can make a difference in the world, their experience of life has to become much more inclusive in a way that a tree is not merely looked at as a table, a chair, or a piece of furniture. A tree is a phenomenal life in itself, and it’s the basis of our life. This has to become a living experience for everybody, only then, there will be sustainability and ecologically economic consciousness.
